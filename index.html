				<h2 id="blog">blog</h2>
				<p>Less than two weeks after launch, PasswordBox had surpassed Gmail as the #1 productivity app, reached the top two trending apps in the Google Play store and saw the user base grow from a few hundred thousand beta users to almost a million users. It was a feat that most startups dont experience in a lifetime, much less in 14 days.</p>
